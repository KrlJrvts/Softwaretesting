# Software testing

Junior level software testing based on TDD methodology.

1. You need to create a folder that starts with the name 'test'
2. You need to create file __init__.py in test folder
3. You need to create a python script that also starts with 'test'
4. You need to create python function that starts with 'test'
5. Test is needed at the beginning of file, because other way pytest can't identify it as a test and will not check


required module to test is pytest
